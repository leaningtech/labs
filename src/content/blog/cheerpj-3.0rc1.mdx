## What's new in CheerpJ 3.0

For the past few years, we have been working tirelessly on a **completely new architecture** for CheerpJ, our solution to run Java applications, applets and libraries on modern browsers.

### Completely new JIT-based architecture

Taking advantage of many years of real-world use of CheerpJ 2.x by hundreds of organisations worldwide, and leveraging many lessons learned from the development of [CheerpX], our browser-based x86 virtual machine, we performed a full rewrite of CheerpJ.

The key features of the new CheerpJ architecture are:

- **Goodbye AOT, hello JIT compilation :** CheerpJ 3.0 features a fully transparent, multi-tier execution model, which starts with a fast interpreter for rarely used code, and combines a JIT compiler for frequently used code. With this new model no code is ever executed or generated for unused classes, improving startup performance. Because there is no AOT compiler or .jar.js files, the integration and deployment of CheerpJ 3.0 is now a matter of adding a few lines to an existing HTML page.
- **Full Classloader support:** Thanks to the new JIT approach, which mimicks how the JVM normally operates, we can now give full control to the appropriate Classloader for class resolution, including application provided ones. This completely eliminates incompatibilities caused by duplicated classes as well.
- **A new scalable JNI architecture:** We now compile 100% of the OpenJDK native code to WebAssembly, providing a viable path for supporting modern versions of Java and potentially specific point versions if a user requires so. This also means that CheerpJ now uses a completely unmodified version of OpenJDK, extending its level of compatibility even more.

Thanks to these architectural advancements, CheerpJ 3.0 can be considered a full WebAssembly-based replacement to the JVM, with a full OpenJDK runtime.

### Seamlessly call into Java with `cheerpjRunLibrary`

CheerpJ 3.0 introduces a new function, [`cheerpjRunLibrary`], which allows you to call into Java code from JavaScript. This function returns a JavaScript object that can be used to call Java methods and instanciate Java objects.

The new library mode makes it easier than ever to build apps like [JavaFiddle](https://javafiddle.leaningtech.com/):

### Simplified Java-to-JavaScript interoperability

Instead of requiring complex build steps and name mangling, [`cheerpjInit`] now supports a `natives` object which can be used to implement Java methods marked `native`, in JavaScript.

```java title="TestClass.java"
package com.example;

public class TestClass {
  public native void alert(String str);
}
```

To provide an implementation of `alert`, simply pass it to the `cheerpjInit` function as a property of the `natives` object:

```js
await cheerpjInit({
	natives: {
		async Java_com_example_TestClass_alert(lib, str) {
			window.alert(str);
		},
	},
});
```

### Improved documentation

We've completely revamped our documentation. It's now easier to navigate and find what you're looking for. We've also added a new [migration guide] to help you upgrade from CheerpJ 2.x to CheerpJ 3.0.
