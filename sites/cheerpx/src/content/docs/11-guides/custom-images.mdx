---

This guide will show you how to configure a Docker container and build it into an `ext2` image for use with CheerpX.

## 1. Create a Dockerfile

First, create your `Dockerfile` to define the environment. Here's an example of how to build a Docker image that installs the `curl` command:

```dockerfile
FROM --platform=i386 docker.io/i386/debian:buster
ARG DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive

RUN apt-get update && apt-get -y upgrade && apt-get -y install curl
```

> [!note] Note
> The base image's architecture must be 32-bit x86 (for example, `i386` or `i686`).

## 2. Create a container out of your Dockerfile

Once the `Dockerfile` is ready, build the image. Use `buildah` to create a container image for your filesystem.

```bash
buildah build -f Dockerfile --dns=none --platform linux/i386 -t cheerpximage
```

## 3. Create a container from the Docker Image

Now, create a container from the image using `podman`. Ensure the image name matches the one you built in the previous step.

```bash
podman create --name cheerpxcontainer cheerpximage
```

## 4. Copy the Filesystem from the Container into a local directory

Create a directory for the filesystem:

```bash
mkdir cheerpXFS
```

Use the podman cp command to copy the containerâ€™s filesystem into the local directory:

```bash
podman unshare podman cp cheerpxcontainer:/ cheerpXFS/
```

> [!note] Note
> The podman unshare command helps avoid permission problems by running the operation in a special mode where you act like the container's "root user."

## 5. Create an ext2 Image from the local directory

Now that you have the local directory, you can create an `ext2` image from it:

```bash
podman unshare mkfs.ext2 -b 4096 -d cheerpXFS/ cheerpXImage.ext2 600M
```

## 6. Clean up unused resources

After creating your `ext2` image, it's good practice to clean up unused resources to free up space:

Remove the container:

```bash
podman rm cheerpxcontainer
```

Remove the image:

```bash
buildah rmi cheerpximage
```

Remove temporary directories:

```bash
rm -rf cheerpXFS
```

## Optional: edit `/etc/subgid` (for the host user)

The `/etc/subgid` file defines the ranges of subordinate group IDs allocated to specific user accounts on the host for managing user namespaces in containers. This step is **optional** and not necessary for most use cases. However, you may choose to configure it if you encounter namespace-related conflicts.

### 1. Identify your host user

Run the following command to determine the host user running container commands:

```bash
whoami
```

### 2. Check `/etc/subgid` for your user

Open `/etc/subgid` and look for an entry matching your user:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/subgid
```

The file should contain lines in the format:

```
<username>:<start_id>:<count>
```

For example, for the user `johndoe`:

```
johndoe:100000:65536
```

### 3. Modify the file

If you need to change the `subgid` range for the host user, modify the `start_id` and/or `count` as needed. For example, if you want to assign a new range starting at 200000 with a count of 65536, you would change it to:

```
johndoe:200000:65536
```

For more information about `subgid`, refer to the [subgid documentation](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/subgid.5.html).

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully created a custom `ext2` image that can be used as a filesystem for CheerpX. This image is now ready to be loaded into your CheerpX environment for further testing and deployment.
