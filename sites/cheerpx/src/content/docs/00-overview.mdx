**CheerpX is an x86 virtualization technology for running executables and operating systems entirely client-side.** It's an always available, zero-cost virtual machine with guaranteed data privacy, powered by a WebAssembly JIT engine.

## What!?

CheerpX enables you to run existing 32-bit x86 native binaries and Linux distributions:

- without modifications;
- without recompilation;
- without source-code;
- fully client-side.

CheerpX is perfect for web-based IDEs, programming tutorials, virtual machines, and interactive demos. It can also be used to provide a secure sandbox for untrusted code. CheerpX is used by [WebVM](https://webvm.io/), [PythonFiddle](https://pythonfiddle.leaningtech.com/), and has been fully tested in production as part of [CheerpX for Flash](/cheerpx-for-flash), an enterprise solution to run legacy Adobe Flash content in the browser.

If you're looking to run Java in the browser, check out [CheerpJ](/cheerpj).

## Comparisons

### CheerpX versus cloud VMs

Cloud based solutions are trivial to implement but also have significant drawbacks in terms of computational costs and user data ownership.

CheerpX is a client-side solution, which means that the code is executed directly in the browser, without any server-side component. This has several advantages:

- **Cost effective.** No need to pay by the minute for cloud VMs.
- **Improved user experience.** No latency. Works offline.
- **Private.** User data never leaves their browser.
- **Secure.** No risk of bad actors running malicious code on your servers.
- **Scale.** Client-side compute increases with the number of users.

### CheerpX versus WebContainers

CheerpX is a more general solution than WebContainers.

WebContainers [can only execute languages that are natively supported on the Web](https://webcontainers.io/guides/troubleshooting#cannot-load-native-addon-error). In practice, this means only Node.js or WebAssembly can be executed. CheerpX supports any x86 executable.

### CheerpX versus porting to WebAssembly

[Porting a large C/C++ codebase to WebAssembly](/cheerp) is not necessarily a simple endeavor. For instance, a programming language implementation will most likely have multiple target-dependent code paths or definition, so the effort required is not dissimilar from porting the language to a new native architecture.

### CheerpX versus v86/JSLinux

CheerpX virtualises at a higher level. v86 and JSLinux emulate specific hardware peripherals, whereas CheerpX implements Linux system calls.

They also require the entire disk image to be downloaded ahead-of-time (so [full 600MB Debian](https://webvm.io) is not really an option). CheerpX can stream the disk image from the server as needed.

v86 and JSLinux are hobby projects, whereas CheerpX is a commercial product with a dedicated team of engineers. If you're shipping with CheerpX, you can [rely on us to provide support and maintenance](https://leaningtech.com/contact-us).

## How it works

At its core, CheerpX is a two-tier emulator for the x86 architecture [implemented in C++ and compiled to JavaScript and WebAssembly](/cheerp). There is both an interpreter and a sophisticated JIT compiler that is able to generate efficient WebAssembly representations for hot code. The whole process is 100% automated and requires no metadata or assumptions whatsoever. The system is so robust that it can deal with applications that generate new code internally at runtime, and even with self-modifying code.

This means that you can actually run things like Node.js, including the full V8 engine with its remarkable JIT and code garbage collection. [Demo.](https://repl.leaningtech.com/?nodejs)

CheerpX currently focuses on user mode (ring 3), and does not fully emulate the kernel (ring 0). We do, however, implement a subset of the Linux system call interface, which is enough to run most applications. We are working on a full system emulation mode - DOS already works.
