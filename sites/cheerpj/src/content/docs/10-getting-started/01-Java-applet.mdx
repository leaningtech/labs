CheerpJ can run Java applets in the browser seamlessly. This page will help you getting started with CheerpJ for Java applets using the CheerpJ runtime environment on your own webpage.

## Running your own applet

**You will need:**

- Your applet file(s)
- The HTML file where your applet is meant to be displayed.
- A basic HTTP server to test locally

### 1. Integrating CheerpJ in your HTML file

This tutorial assumes you already have an HTML file with an `<applet>`, `<object>` or `<embed>` tag.

In order to integrate CheerpJ, you just need to add:

1.  A simple `<script>` within the `<head>` of your page with the CheerpJ runtime loader.

```html
<script src="https://cjrtnc.leaningtech.com/4.2/loader.js"></script>
```

2.  A second script calling [`cheerpjInit()`] to initialize CheerpJ's runtime environment.

```html
<script>
	cheerpjInit();
</script>
```

For example:

```html title="index.html" {6, 15-17}
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8" />
		<title>CheerpJ applet test</title>
		<script src="https://cjrtnc.leaningtech.com/4.2/loader.js"></script>
	</head>
	<body>
		<applet
			archive="Example.jar"
			code="ExamplePath.ExampleApplet"
			height="900"
			width="900"
		></applet>
		<script>
			cheerpjInit();
		</script>
	</body>
</html>
```

> [!info] Java Applets and Java 8
> The method ´cheerpJInit´ runs Java 8 by default if the Java version is not specified. Please notice that if you change the version to Java 11 or higher, applets won't work.

### 2. Host your page locally

You can now serve this web page on a simple HTTP server, such as the http-server utility.

```shell
npm install http-server
http-server -p 8080
```

> In case your users have a native Java plugin installed, you can replace the original HTML tag with a `cheerpj-` prefixed version. `<cheerpj-applet>`, `<cheerpj-object>`, and `<cheerpj-embed>` are all supported.

## The result

You will see the CheerpJ display on your browser with some loading messages before showing your applet running. Depending on your application and the optimizations applied, this could take just a few seconds.
