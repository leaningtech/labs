With CheerpJ, a Java application can interact with JavaScript in a browser environment, enabling seamless interaction between Java and JavaScript code.

In this tutorial, we’ll teach you how to create a two-way communication channel between Java and JavaScript using CheerpJ. This setup will allow a Java class to access JavaScript functions and vice versa, enabling data exchange between the two environments.

We will use a long-running Java thread to enable callbacks into our Java application at any time. It is also possible to call back into Java using native methods, which we explain further in our [`native methods guide`].

## Prerequisites

- [Download the template project](/docs/cheerpj3/tutorials/CheerpJInteroperabilityTutorial.zip) and unzip it.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (>= 18)

## Project structure

The project consists of the following files and directories:

```plaintext
CheerpJInteroperabilityTutorial/
├── com/example
│   └── Example.java
│   └── manifest.txt
│   └── Example.class (and other compiled .class files)
├── index.html
└── example.jar
└── Makefile

```

In this tutorial, we will implement the native methods in JavaScript in the `index.html` file to enable communication between Java and JavaScript.

You can see the fully implemented example on [GitHub](https://github.com/leaningtech/cheerpj-meta/tree/main/examples/Interoperability).

## Java source code: `Example.java`

Let's start by examining the source code of the Java class that will interact with JavaScript. This class will receive input from JavaScript, process it, and send a response back to JavaScript.

```java title="Example.java"
package com.example;

public class Example {
    public static native void sendToHTML(String s);

    public String processInput(String input) {
        sendToHTML(input);
        return "Java received: " + input;
    }

    public static native void nativeSetApplication(Example myApplication);

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Example app = new Example();
        new Thread(() -> {
            nativeSetApplication(app);
            System.out.println("Starting Thread");
        }).start();
    }
}
```

This Java class contains the following methods:

- `sendToHTML`: A native method implemented in JavaScript, called to send data to the JavaScript environment.
- `processInput`: Receives data from JavaScript, passes it to `sendToHTML`, and returns a response.
- `nativeSetApplication`: Captures the running Java thread for persistent communication with JavaScript.

<Callout title="Note" variant="important">
	There is **no need to recompile the Java code** for this tutorial, as a
	precompiled file is provided in the template project. However, if you want to
	modify the Java code, you will need to recompile it. To do so, follow the
	instructions in the [Running the example](#running-the-example) section.
</Callout>

## JavaScript native method implementation

To enable Java and JavaScript communication, we need to implement the [`native`] methods in JavaScript. These methods will handle the data exchange between the two environments.

We will do this in the `index.html` file, which is part of the template project `.zip` file. In this file, you will find useful comments to guide you through the implementation process described below.

### 1. Define JavaScript native methods

In the `<script>` tag, implement the native methods for interacting with Java.

To implement the native methods in JavaScript, we create an `async` function for each Java method following the naming convention `Java_<fully-qualified-class-name>_<method-name>`. The function should accept `lib` as the first parameter and the Java instance as the second parameter (if applicable). See the [`native method`] implementation guide for more details.

You can move these methods to a separate `.js` file for better organization and include them using the `<script>` tag in the HTML.

```js title="index.html"
async function Java_com_example_Example_sendToHTML(lib, str) {
	document.getElementById("javaOutput").innerText =
		"JavaScript received: " + str;
	console.log("Received input from Java: " + str);
}

async function Java_com_example_Example_nativeSetApplication(
	lib,
	myApplication
) {
	window.myApplication = myApplication;
	console.log("Java application instance set on JavaScript side.");
	// Make the inputDiv visible after initialization
	document.getElementById("inputDiv").style.display = "block";
	return new Promise(() => {}); // Keeps the function from returning
}
```

The `Java_com_example_Example_nativeSetApplication` function:

- Assigns the Java application instance to `window.myApplication`.
- Ensures continuous access by preventing the function from returning.

The `Java_com_example_Example_sendToHTML` function:

- Receives input from Java.
- Displays the input in the HTML document.

### 2. Implement the `sendInputToJava` function

Write a function to send input to Java:

```js title="index.html"
async function sendInputToJava() {
	const inputText = document.getElementById("inputText").value;
	const response = await window.myApplication.processInput(inputText);
}
```

The `sendInputToJava` function:

- Retrieves input from an HTML input box.
- Sends it to the Java method and displays the response in an alert.

### 3. Initialize CheerpJ

To use CheerpJ, include the following script in the `<head>` section of `index.html`:

```js title="index.html"
<script src="https://cjrtnc.leaningtech.com/4.0/loader.js"></script>
```

To load CheerpJ, we initialize it in the HTML file with specific configurations for native methods.

```js title="index.html"
(async () => {
	await cheerpjInit({
		version: 8,
		natives: {
			Java_com_example_Example_sendToHTML,
			Java_com_example_Example_nativeSetApplication,
		},
	});
	cheerpjCreateDisplay(800, 600);
	await cheerpjRunJar("/app/example.jar");
})();
```

Explanation:

- `cheerpjInit`: Initializes CheerpJ with the specified configurations:
  - `version`: Specifies the Java version to use.
  - `natives`: Lists JavaScript implementations of native Java methods.
- `cheerpjCreateDisplay`: Creates a display area for any graphical output (optional in this example).
- `cheerpjRunJar`: Loads and runs the provided JAR file.

## Running the example

1. There is **no need to recompile the Java code** for this tutorial as we only changed the JavaScript code and you can use the precompiled `example.jar` file provided in the template project. However, if you want to modify the Java code, you can recompile it using the provided `Makefile` (requires Java installed):

```bash
make
```

Alternatively, compile and package manually:

```bash
javac Example.java
jar cvfm example.jar manifest.txt com/example/*.class
```

2. **Start a Local Server**: Serve the files using a simple HTTP server like [`http-server`]:

```bash
npx http-server -p 8080
```

3. **Run the Example**: Open http://localhost:8080/index.html in your browser.
