WebVM 2.0 came out with big improvements for graphical applications support, including booting a complete Alpine desktop environment.
For now, we have settled on using i3, a minimalistic window manager, to make sure the demo is enjoyable by most users, even on mobile devices, without consuming excessive amounts of data. Further improvements in our roadmap will make it practical to run the much heavier XFCE environment in future releases.
