Linux Dungeon is a browser-based fantasy puzzle game that runs entirely in a virtual Linux terminal. Players take on the role of an adventurer trapped in a digital dungeon, where the only way forward is to master real Linux commands. Each room is sealed inside a password-protected .zip file, and players must explore directories, decode clues, and edit configs to advance.

This project was built for the WebVM: Hackathon II, which challenged developers to create educational Linux experiences using CheerpX.
