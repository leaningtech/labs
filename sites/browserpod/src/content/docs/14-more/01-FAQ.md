## What is BrowserPod?

BrowserPod is a universal execution layer for browser-based compute. It provides a sandboxed runtime API for running untrusted code—including AI-generated code, user scripts, or agent-assembled programs—safely inside the browser using WebAssembly. It includes a Linux-compliant environment with a virtual filesystem, process isolation, and Portals for controlled networking.

## Do I need a backend server?

No. The Node.js server runs inside the browser. You only need to host the outer web app.

## Do I need an API key?

Yes. `BrowserPod.boot` requires an API key.

## Why does BrowserPod need COOP and COEP headers?

BrowserPod uses `SharedArrayBuffer`, which requires cross-origin isolation. COOP and COEP headers enable that isolation.

## Do native binaries work?

Not directly. Use Wasm-compatible alternatives or `package.json` overrides when available.

## Which browsers are supported?

All the major browsers on desktop and mobile (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) are supported.

## Is BrowserPod good for AI-generated code?

Yes. BrowserPod is specifically designed for executing untrusted code, including code generated by AI models or agents. It provides strong isolation through the browser's security sandbox, keeping execution local to the user's device while maintaining high fidelity with native environments.

## How does BrowserPod compare to cloud sandboxes?

BrowserPod runs on the user's device rather than provisioning cloud infrastructure for each session. This means:

- **Lower cost**: No per-session VM costs. Computation uses underutilized client resources.
- **Lower latency**: No cold starts or network round trips to remote servers.
- **Better data locality**: User inputs and code execution stay in the browser by default, reducing your attack surface and compliance requirements.
- **High fidelity**: Full Linux-compliant environment, not a limited simulation.

## Is my data secure in BrowserPod?

Yes. BrowserPod runs entirely within the browser's security sandbox, which is battle-tested and continuously hardened by browser vendors. Code running in a Pod cannot access the user's operating system, local files (unless explicitly provided), or other browser tabs. Data stays on the user's device by default unless your application specifically transmits it elsewhere.

## What is the performance like?

BrowserPod uses WebAssembly to run runtime engines at near-native speed. It supports real multi-process workloads with true concurrency via WebWorkers. Performance is suitable for computationally heavy tasks, including development tools, build pipelines, and AI code execution.

## What are Portals?

Portals are BrowserPod's controlled networking feature. When code inside a Pod listens on a port, BrowserPod automatically creates a secure, shareable URL that routes traffic to that service. This enables live previews, interactive demos, and collaborative workflows without provisioning dedicated backend infrastructure.
