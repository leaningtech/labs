A Pod is an instance of BrowserPod. It is a Wasm object that boots in the browser.

### A Pod's default filesystem

By default, a Pod's filesystem is intentionally minimal. An empty Pod on boot contains:

<FileTree client:load node={podFs} />

#### What these files and folders *mean for you*

Think of this as the “bare minimum” runtime. BrowserPod ships only what it needs to run Node.js and npm — nothing more.

- `.node_repl_history`  
  This only matters if you start the Node REPL. It stores your previous REPL commands. You can ignore it for normal apps.

- `etc/hosts`  
  This is a basic hostname map. It exists so things that expect `localhost` to resolve actually work inside the pod.  
  If your app binds to `localhost`, this file makes sure that name is understood internally.

- `etc/resolv.conf`  
  This is the DNS config file. It exists so Node can resolve external domains (e.g., when you `fetch()` a URL).  
  You usually don’t touch it, but it explains why network calls work in the pod.

- `lost+found`  
  A standard filesystem recovery folder. It’s empty and not something you need to use.

- `npm/`  
  This is the **bundled npm installation** that BrowserPod provides so you can run `npm install`.  
  Files like `161.js`, `171.js`, `871.js` are **internal npm code files** that npm loads at runtime. You don’t need to edit or use them directly — they’re just part of how npm is packaged.  
  The important part is:
  - `npm/bin/npm.js` → the npm command entrypoint used when you run `pod.run('npm', ...)`.

Notes:

- `/bin`, `/usr/bin`, and `/project` do **not** exist by default.
- You create `/project` when you copy your app into the pod.
