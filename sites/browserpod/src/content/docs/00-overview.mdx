Instant, in-browser runtime for Node.js, Python, and Ruby on Rails to power the future of Web-based developer experiences.

Run Node.js projects in your browser, unmodified (Python, Ruby, and more coming in the future).

Access the local http server in the same page or from another tab to view, test, and iterate; or share it with others, thanks to Portals.

See it in action in our [SvelteKit+Vite demo](https://vitedemo.browserpod.io)

## Use Cases

### Project showcase

Run a demo of your project directly in the user's browser, without any explicit setup or installation, and secured by the browser's sandbox.

### Interactive documentation / tutorials

Enrich your documentation and tutorials with interactive components, without the need for any server-side infrastructure.

### AI Agents environment

Let AI assistants and Agents run loose on your project, but isolated from the rest of your system.

## Getting started

BrowserPod has a simple yet powerful [API](/docs/reference).

You can get up an running with few simple steps by following our [Quickstart](/docs/getting-started) page.

## How does BrowserPod work?

BrowserPod is built on top of CheerpOS, an Operating System interface that provides the Linux syscall interface to Wasm programs running in the Browser.

BrowserPod ships with a build of Node.js that targets CheerpOS.

Instead of using an embedded V8 engine to run JavaScript, the Browser's engine is used instead.

This allows BrowserPod to run your JavaScript code at native speed.

Everything else (Node's builtin JS modules, libuv, and Node's internal C++ code) stays the same, to guarantee maximum compatibility.

Multiple versions of Node will be supported, and we plan to support new LTS versions in a timely manner.

Using the same foundation, we plan to support other languages and frameworks, like Python and Ruby (including Ruby on Rails).

## Licensing

BrowserPod is free for personal use and technical evaluation. See [licensing](/docs/licensing) for details.

## Demos

You can see BrowserPod in action in our [SvelteKit+Vite demo](https://vitedemo.browserpod.io)

## Community

We have a vibrant Discord community where you can ask questions, share your projects, and get community support.
