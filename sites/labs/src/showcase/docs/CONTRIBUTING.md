## Documentation

Documentation is written in Markdown and MDX and is located in the `src/content/docs` directory of [Labs](#labs).

### Style guide

In brief:

- Use [Diataxis](https://diataxis.fr/) for structure
- Be concise but thorough; you can always link to more information or provide it in a callout
- Always use examples
- Avoid "I" and "you"; use "we" if necessary

## Labs

Labs is the codebase for the Leaning Technologies developer site. It is built using [Astro](https://astro.build), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev).

### Setup

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
3. Clone the repo, e.g. with `gh clone leaningtech/labs`
4. Change into the directory: `cd labs/sites/labs`
5. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
6. Spawn development server: `pnpm start`
7. Visit [localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321)

### Linting

Linters run automatically in [this GitHub Action workflow](https://github.com/leaningtech/labs/actions/workflows/lint.yml). You can also run them locally.

#### Prose

Vale checks style and grammar in Markdown files, like capitalisation of certain words, use of passive voice, and more.

1. Install [Vale](https://vale.sh/docs/vale-cli/installation/)
2. Download style rules: `vale sync`
3. Check with Vale: `vale .`

For editor integration, use:

- Visual Studio Code: [`chrischinchilla.vale-vscode`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ChrisChinchilla.vale-vscode)
- Vim: [ALE](https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale)

Vale is quite brittle, particularly on MDX files. It's okay if there are errors, but please look at them to see if they are valid. Hopefully we can improve this in the future.

#### Prettier

Prettier is a code formatter. It's shipped as a `devDependency`, so `pnpm install` will have installed it.

To format all files:

```shell
$ pnpm format
```

### Astro diagnostics

Astro has some of its own diagnostics.

```shell
$ pnpm astro check
```

### TypeScript

```shell
$ pnpm tsc
```
