> [!info]About downloads permission
> CheerpJ JNLP Runner needs to see your downloads. This is because the classic way to run JNLP applications is by triggering the download of its corresponding JNLP file. When CheerpJ JNLP Runner detects the download of a JNLP file it will start working with your Java application.

## Step 2

Once the extension is installed you will see the small logo to the right of the browsing bar. If the logo is not there, click on the puzzle icon to see all your installed extensions, it should appear there. Here you can click on the extension's menu (three dots) and select _*Show in Toolbar*_ .
