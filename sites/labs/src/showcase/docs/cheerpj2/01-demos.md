To showcase the capabilities of the CheerpJ compiler we have published several demos

## OpenAstexViewer

<img src="/assets/cheerpj2/demo_openastex.png" width="400">

This demo highlights how complex Java applets with 3D rendering can efficiently and safely run in any browser using CheerpJ.

This specific applet is a visualization tool for protein structures.

## JavaFiddle

<img src="/assets/cheerpj2/demo_fiddle.png" width="400">

A playground to compile and run Java programs directly in the browser. Both console and GUI applications are supported. The standard `javac` compiler is used, since `javac` is also written in Java the whole compiler runs in the browser, together with the compiled application.

## iText Demo

<img src="/assets/cheerpj2/demo_itext.png" width="400">

Edit PDFs fully client side using the industry standard [iText](https://itextpdf.com/en) library converted to JavaScript. This demo demonstrates how CheerpJ APIs can be used to instance Java objects and call methods directly from JavaScript.
