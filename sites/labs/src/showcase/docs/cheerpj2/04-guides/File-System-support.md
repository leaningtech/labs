title: File System support
---

CheerpJ provides full filesystem support for converted Java applications.

Read only and read/write filesystems are exposed in Java and can be used to read, write and manipulate files as normally when running on a JVM.

**Note**: CheerpJ provides access to a virtualized filesystem, which does not correspond to the local computer. Accessing local files from the browser it's forbidden for security reasons.

## File Systems in CheerpJ

CheerpJ implements three main filesystem concepts:

1. A read-only, HTTP-based filesystem
2. A read/write, IndexedDB-based, persistent filesystem
3. A read-only, memory based filesystem

CheerpJ filesystems are implemented as UNIX-style virtual filesystems with multiple mount points. The default mount points are defined as follows:

| Mount     | Description                                                                                               |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/app/`   | An HTTP-based read-only filesystem, used to access JARs and data from your local server                   |
| `/files/` | An IndexedDB-based, persistent read-write file system                                                     |
| `/lt/`    | Another HTTP-based read-only filesystem, pointing to the CheerpJ runtime                                  |
| `/str/`   | A read-only filesystem to easily share JavaScript Strings or binary data (an `Uint8Array`) with Java code |

## `/app/` mount point

The /app/ mount point corresponds to a virtual read-only, HTTP-based filesystem. `/app/` is used to access JAR files and data from your local server.

The `/app/` directory is virtual, and only exists inside of CheerpJ. It is required to distinguish files from the local server from runtime files and files stored in the browser database.

The `/app/` directory refers to the root of your web server. So, assuming that your web server is available at `http://127.0.0.1:8080/`, here are some example file mappings:

- `/app/example.jar` → `http://127.0.0.1:8080/example.jar`
- `/app/subdirectory/example.txt` → `http://127.0.0.1:8080/subdirectory/example.txt`

## `/files/` mount point

The `/files/` mount point corresponds to a virtual read-write, IndexedDB-based filesystem. `/files/` is used to store persistent data on the browser client.

The `/files/` directory is a virtual concept used by CheerpJ to store and refer to files.

## `/str/` mount point

The `/str/` mount point is a simple read-only filesystem that can be populated from JavaScript to share data with Java code.

From JavaScript you can add files into the filesystem using the `cheerpjAddStringFile` API. Example:

```js
cheerpjAddStringFile("/str/fileName.txt", "Some text in a JS String");
```

You can access this data from Java, for example:

```java
import java.io.FileReader;
...

FileReader f = new FileReader("/str/fileName.txt")
...
```

The `cheerpjAddStringFile` API can be used with JavaScript `String`s or `Uint8Array`s. `Uint8Array`s may be useful to provide binary data to the Java application, for example a user selected file coming from an HTML5 `<input type="file">` tag.
