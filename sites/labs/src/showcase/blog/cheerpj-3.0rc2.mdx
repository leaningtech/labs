## New features in CheerpJ 3.0rc2

### Improvements to library mode

Library mode is a feature in CheerpJ 3.0 that allows JavaScript to use Java classes seamlessly.

In CheerpJ 3.0rc1, library mode was limited to calling constructors and methods. We've expanded the feature set to include:

- Passing JS arrays to Java arrays via copying. Standard arrays, typed arrays, and multidimensional arrays are supported.
- Passing JS arrays to Java `JSObject`: The incoming value is wrapped and opaquely stored in a Java `JSObject`, and can be passed back to JS for further operations.
- Passing Java object arrays to JavaScript by reference. Changes to the array on the JS side will be visible on the Java side. Uses Proxies.
- Passing Java primitive arrays to JavaScript: efficiently supported via typed arrays.
- Public Java fields can now be both read/written from JS with appropriate type conversion.
- Classes in JS now support `instanceof`, reflecting the `extends` relationship in Java. Due to limitations of JS inheritance model, instanceof checks of Java interfaces will not work.

These features are available in the [`cheerpjRunLibrary`] and [JNI] APIs.

### Web Worker support

CheerpJ 3.0rc2 adds support for Web Workers. Simply call [`importScripts`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WorkerGlobalScope/importScripts) from a worker to load CheerpJ, then use CheerpJ as usual.

```js
importScripts("https://cjrtnc.leaningtech.com/3.0rc2/cj3loader.js");

// Use CheerpJ as usual
(async () => {
  await cheerpjInit();
  const lib = await cheerpjRunLibrary("/app/example.jar");
  // ...
)();
```

Note that:

- This **replaces** the [`CheerpJWorker`](/cheerpj2/reference/WebWorker-API) API (CheerpJ 2 only).
- Anything that requires DOM access (such as displaying a UI) is not supported in a worker.

[`cheerpjRunLibrary`]: /cheerpj3/reference/cheerpjRunLibrary

### Improved font support

CheerpJ now ships fonts for international character sets.
