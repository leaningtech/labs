Here at Leaning Technologies, we love WebAssembly. Its safe, efficient, and fast
properties have allowed us to run complicated, large codebases right in users'
browsers, such as [Minecraft](https://browsercraft.cheerpj.com/), [IntelIJ Idea](https://twitter.com/alexpignotti/status/1729915428258926713) as well as
[Linux virtual machines](https://webvm.io/).

But, compared to native platforms, WebAssembly has a caveat that makes it
sometimes difficult to work with.

_WebAssembly has no memory protection_ like one would have on native. This means we
get little to no feedback if our program tries to access memory it is not allowed to access. Leaving us oblivious to the presence of such an error. And even if we are aware of it, we have no easy way to locate it, often leading to long debugging sessions.

And perhaps to add insult to injury, we write our software using C and C++, which offer lots
of efficiency, but also lots of avenues for introducing memory errors.

On native, this problem has been slightly relieved by the development of
tools that can detect these memory errors (such as Valgrind). But on the
browser, this doesn't really exist.

So we set out to solve that.

## AddressSanitizer to the rescue!

Cheerp, as of recently, supports compiling code with [ASan](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer) (**A**ddress**San**itizer).

ASan is a tool that can be used to detect common programming errors such as:

- Use after free
- Heap buffer overflow
- Stack buffer overflow
- Use after return
- Use after scope
- Initialization order bugs
- Memory leaks

All while slowing down a program about 2x on average, which is noticeable, but still allows manual testing.

## An example

```c
int main() {
  int* p = 0;
  return *p;
}
```

When compiled and run on my machine I'm greeted with the following message:

```
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```

Informing me that my code tried to do something it wasn't allowed to.

Compiling that code to Wasm with Cheerp and running it is less helpful:

```bash
$ /opt/cheerp/bin/clang test.c
$ node a.out
```

Giving us absolutely no hint that our code has a bug. As noted in the beginning, this is because WebAssembly has no memory protection.

Let's try that again, this time compiling our code with ASan:

```bash
$ /opt/cheerp/bin/clang test.c -cheerp-pretty-code -fsanitize=address
$ node a.out
=================================================================

```

This time, when we run our program, we instead get a detailed error report
informing us that we tried to read 4 bytes from the null address in the function `main`.

## How does it work?

ASan keeps track of what memory the program is and isn't
allowed to access, and inserts checks before each store or load like this:

Before:

```cpp
*address = ...;  // or: ... = *address;
```

After:

```cpp
if (IsPoisoned(address)) {
  ReportError(address, kAccessSize, kIsWrite);
}
*address = ...;  // or: ... = *address;
```

\*Example from the [ASan documentation](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerAlgorithm#short-version)

"Poisoned" here means that the program is _not_ allowed to access that memory.

## How does it _really_ work?

As I see it, there are three big parts to ASan:

- Memory mapping
- Instrumentation
- Runtime library

If we really want to understand ASan, we'll have to go through them one by one.

\*Please note that parts of this explanation are still simplified. If you really
want to understand ASan then I'd recommend reading the [original paper
introducing the concept](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/atc12/atc12-final39.pdf)
and looking into the source code in LLVM.

### Memory mapping

ASan splits the virtual address space into 2 disjoint classes:

- Main application memory
- Shadow memory

Main application memory is the memory that we all love and use.
Shadow memory is used internally by ASan to keep track of which parts of the main
memory the program is allowed to access (it “shadows” the main memory). To be exact, for every 8 bytes of application memory, a byte is used to store how many of those 8 bytes are accessible:

- All 8 bytes are unpoisoned. The shadow value is 0
- All 8 bytes are poisoned. The shadow value is negative
- First `k` bytes are unpoisoned, the rest `8-k` are poisoned. The shadow value is `k`

The shadow memory will then be placed at some known location so that it can be loaded on runtime to check if an address is poisoned or not.

You might be wondering how ASan will protect its shadow memory. On native it usually maps the area of the shadow memory that shadows the shadow memory to protected memory, making the address space look something like this:
![Address Sanitizer memory mapping](./cheerp-asan-memory-mapping.png)

This will cause the program to crash when trying to check if it was allowed to read the shadow memory. But as I said in the introduction, WebAssembly does not have this kind of memory protection. So what we do instead is poison the entire shadow region.

### Instrumentation (load and stores)

Now that we know how/where to check that we can access some memory address, we
can make the instrumentation a bit more concrete:

For 8-byte accesses, the instrumentation looks like this:

```cpp
byte *shadow_address = MemToShadow(address);
byte shadow_value = *shadow_address;
if (shadow_value) {
  ReportError(address, kAccessSize, kIsWrite);
}
```

For 1-, 2- or 4- byte accesses:

```cpp
byte *shadow_address = MemToShadow(address);
byte shadow_value = *shadow_address;
if (shadow_value && ((address & 7) + kAccessSize > shadow_value)) {
  ReportError(address, kAccessSize, kIsWrite);
}
```

\*This is a slightly modified example from the [ASan documentation](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerAlgorithm#mapping)

### Instrumentation (stack)

For stack allocations, the compiler will insert so called "redzones" (basically
poisoned memory regions) before and after the allocation. For example, the
following c++ code:

```cpp
void foo() {
  char a[8];
  ...
  return;
}
```

After instrumentation, it will look something like this:

```cpp
void foo() {
  char redzone1[32];  // 32-byte aligned
  char a[8];      	// 32-byte aligned
  char redzone2[24];
  char redzone3[32];  // 32-byte aligned
  int  *shadow_base = MemToShadow(redzone1);
  shadow_base[0] = 0xffffffff;  // poison redzone1
  shadow_base[1] = 0xffffff00;  // poison redzone2, unpoison 'a'
  shadow_base[2] = 0xffffffff;  // poison redzone3
  ...
  shadow_base[0] = shadow_base[1] = shadow_base[2] = 0; // unpoison all
  return;
}
```

\*Example from the [ASan documentation](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerAlgorithm#stack)

Something similar happens to global values, which I'll not go into detail here.

### Runtime library

The last part of the puzzle is the runtime library. This replaces the functions
`malloc` and `free`, as well as a few other standard library functions, and also
adds error reporting functions.

The new `malloc` will allocate the requested amount with redzones around it.
The new `free` will poison the entire region and put the chunk into
something called "quarantine" (which basically means it's less likely to be
returned from a call to `malloc`)

Combining these concepts together gives us the ASan tool.

## Trophies

Although ASan is actually quite a simple system, it has already found the
following bugs in our products:

- 2x Use after free in our tests
- 1x Use after free in CheerpX
- 1x Nullptr dereference in CheerpX
- 1x Undefined behavior in CheerpJ

## Give it a try!

ASan is now included in our nightly builds of Cheerp. You can download Cheerp
[here](https://leaningtech.com/cheerp/#download). For Debian/Ubuntu, consider using our nightly [PPA](https://launchpad.net/~leaningtech-dev/+archive/ubuntu/cheerp-nightly-ppa).

If you want more details on how to use ASan for Cheerp or Cheerp itself, check
out the [Cheerp documentation](https://labs.leaningtech.com/cheerp).

Leaning Technologies core developers. We are always happy to help!

We hope you will enjoy using Cheerp. See you soon!
