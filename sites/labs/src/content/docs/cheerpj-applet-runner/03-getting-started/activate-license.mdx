This tutorial will guide you step by step on how to activate your extension license.

## Prerequisites

There are two ways to activate your license. Please follow the section that applies to you:

- **License Key (Most Users)**: You can purchase a license key from the <a href="/payment-applet" target="_blank">_**Leaning Technologies shop**_</a> and activate it by following the **Activation via license key** section.
- **License Token**: If you received a license token, typically for technical evaluations or organizational licenses â€” see the **Offline activation via License Token** section.

## Activation via license key

### Purchase License

In order to activate your license, click on the _**Manage License**_ button on the popup.

## Offline activation via License Token

If you have been provided with a license token, you can activate your license offline. From the extension's home screen or popup, click on the _**Manage License**_ link, then select _**Enter License**_. Click on the _**License Token activation**_ checkbox, enter your license token and click on the _**Validate**_ button.
