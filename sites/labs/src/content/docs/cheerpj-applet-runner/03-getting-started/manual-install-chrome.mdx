This tutorial will take you step by step on how to manually install CheerpJ Applet Runner in Google Chrome, enabling efficient testing and troubleshooting.

> [!note] Important
> Please note that this installation process is typically reserved for special testing scenarios. We provide these unpacked builds exclusively to potential customers who encounter issues with the standard version of our extension. This approach allows us to offer quick support and solutions tailored to specific problems. Therefore, access to these builds is granted under certain circumstances to ensure effective and targeted troubleshooting.

## Step 1: Unzip the Extension

Let's start by extracting the extension file into a folder. Ensure that this folder includes the _**manifest.json**_ file, which is crucial for Chrome to recognize and load the extension.
