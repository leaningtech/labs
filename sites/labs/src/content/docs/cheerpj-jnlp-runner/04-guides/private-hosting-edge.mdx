If your organisation requires to use our extension in multiple devices, we have amazing news for you! Our JNLP Runner extension is available for private hosting and deployment via Group Policy. This way, you can deploy our extension for multiple users under your organisation simultaneously and administrate it from a single place. This page will take you step by step on how to do this.

Requirements:

- The appropriate IT permissions at your organisation.
- The JNLP Runner extension CRX file.

## The CRX File and `DownloadURL`

The CRX file is a compressed format for browser extensions. To obtain the CRX file of the JNLP runner extension for self-hosting, you will need to [contact us](https://cheerpj.com/contact/) and we will be happy to provide it for you alongside a license token.

You will need to host the extension CRX file in the appropriate location of your IT infrastructure and create a DownloadURL to access it. You will need this URL later in the tutorial.

> [!info] About `DownloadURL`
> You can also use the Edge add-ons store `DownloadURL`, but you won't be self-hosting the extension and it will be retrieved from the Edge store for all your users. This is a limitation for IT infrastructures where the organisation devices do not have connection permissions to the wider internet. For this reason we recommend the self-hosting method.

## The extension ID

The extension ID is a unique identifier you can easily retrieve from the [extension URL of Edge's Add-ons store](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/cheerpj-jnlp-runner/dpleickbpchmkpkmicanfolmianepfhe) (last 32 characters):

```
https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/cheerpj-jnlp-runner/dpleickbpchmkpkmicanfolmianepfhe
```

The extension ID is:

```
dpleickbpchmkpkmicanfolmianepfhe
```

## The policy string

Now that you have the extension's CRX file and ID, you can build the policy string by merging the extension's ID and the CRX Download URL separated by a semicolon:
`ID;DownloadURL`
It must look something like this:
`dpleickbpchmkpkmicanfolmianepfhe;https://some.download.url.file.crx`

> [!warning] Hypothetical policy string
> The example above contains hypothetical URL, please do not use this policy string.

## Policy templates

You need to install the Microsoft Edge Administrative template to configure policies for Edge. Please follow [this tutorial by Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/deployedge/configure-microsoft-edge#1-download-and-install-the-microsoft-edge-administrative-template)

	label="Edge policies"
	type="primary"
	iconRight="ri:edge-fill"
/>
## Creating a new group policy

Now you have everything you need to create a new GPO, please follow these final steps to create a Group Policy. You can skip this step and just edit an existing one.

1. Open the Group Policy Management interface
2. Go to your desired domain and right click to display the options menu.
3. Click on _**Create a GPO in this domain, and Link it here...**_
4. Name your policy object and hit _**Ok**_.

## Force-install

You can now configure your Group Policy to force install the extension in all your organisation browsers. To do so, you will need the Policy String from the previous step and follow this [force-install tutorial by Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/deployedge/microsoft-edge-manage-extensions-policies#force-install-an-extension)

## Licensing and further group policy setup

The final step is to setup your license among other relevant configurations for this Group Policy.

1. Open the _**Group Policy Management**_ interface, find the JNLP Runner group policy you created previously (or your existing policy) and click _**Edit**_.
2. Find _**Microsoft Edge**_ > _**Extensions**_ > _**Configure Extension management setting policy**_.
3. On the right side menu click on _**Configure Extension management settings**_.

In this window you can configure all the settings relevant for your organisation when using the JNLP runner extension. To do so you need to input the relevant settings in JSON format into the editor. This is done by editing the JSON string shown in the interface using the format:

```json
{ "*": { "FieldKey": "FieldValue" } }
```

They Key **(_\*_)** will apply the settings to all extensions or apps under this policy.
Remember to use the extension ID for those settings that you want to apply only for the JNLP Runner extension.

```json
{ "ExtensionIDHere": { "SettingField": "FieldValues" } }
```

### Licensing

To correctly configure your license, make sure to include the license token field in your JSON:

```json
{ "ExtensionIDHere": { "licenseToken": "YourValidTokenHere" } }
```

### Other settings

Remember you can always configure other settings for this Group Policy that are appropriate for your group of users and the extension. You can do this in this same JSON adding the appropriate key/values as the examples shown below:

For example:

- Always pin this extension to the browser toolbar

```json
{ "ExtensionIDHere": { "toolbar_state": "force_shown" } }
```

- Block extension from interacting with certain websites:

  ```json
  { "runtime_blocked_hosts": ["*://an.example.com"] }
  ```

- Allow the extension to interact with specific websites even when they're in the blocked list:

```json
{ "runtime_allowed_hosts": ["*://an.example.com"] }
```

## Update your changes

Once you are happy with your group policy configuration, you can apply these changes to see them reflected on your user's Edge clients by running the shell command:

```shell
 gpupdate
```
