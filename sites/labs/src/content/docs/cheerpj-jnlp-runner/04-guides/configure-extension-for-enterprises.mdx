description: How to configure the JNLP Runner extension for enterprises
---

As an administrator, you can configure browser extensions for Chrome and Edge using the Windows Group Policy Editor or the Windows Registry.
This applies to the CheerpJ JNLP Runner extension as well, allowing you to customize the extension to meet your users' needs.

The following steps assume that you have a basic understanding of using Group Policy and editing the Windows Registry.

For more detailed guidance, please refer to the official [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/7532015)
and [Edge](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/deployedge/microsoft-edge-manage-extensions-policies) documentation on configuring browser extensions for enterprise use.

## The extension ID

The _extension ID_ is a unique identifier used to differentiate one extension from another.
It is required when configuring extensions using the Windows Group Policy Editor or setting them in the registry.

The _extension ID_ of the official **Edge** Add-ons store version is:

```
dpleickbpchmkpkmicanfolmianepfhe
```

The _extension ID_ of the official **Chrome** Webstore version is:

```
achnhggjjhnadfapkmgallnbmemdojdi
```

If you are self-hosting a custom build of the JNLP Runner, the _extension ID_ will differ.
We either provided you with the _extension ID_, or you will need to retrieve it yourself.
To obtain the _extension ID_ for a custom build, drag the CRX file onto your browser's Extensions page.
You can navigate there by clicking the three dots in the top-right corner of the browser and selecting **Extensions**. Once the extension is loaded, you can note the ID.

## Configure with the Group Policies

A common way to configure your extensions is by using the `ExtensionSettings` policy, which includes multiple options for admins to set up extensions for users.
The `ExtensionSettings` policy enables you to configure multiple settings in one place using a JSON string in the Windows Group Policy Editor.

For more information on the ExtensionSettings policy, please refer to the official documentation for [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/7532015)
and [Edge](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/deployedge/microsoft-edge-manage-extensions-ref-guide).

### Configure `ExtensionsSettings` policy with JSON format

You can access the `ExtensionSettings` policy through the Group Policy Editor. The location of the policy varies depending on the browser you are using.

- **_Edge:_** In the Group Policy Editor, go to **Administrative Templates > Microsoft Edge > Extensions > Configure extension management setting policy**

- **_Chrome:_** In the Group Policy Editor, go to **Administrative Templates > Google > Google Chrome > Extensions > Configure extension management setting policy**

You will need to **enable** the policy and enter the policy string in JSON format as a **single line**. To validate and compress the policy into a single line, use a JSON compression tool.

The policy string should include the _extension ID_ and the different policy settings you want to configure. Here is an example:

```json
{ "ExtensionIDHere": { "Setting1": "Value1", "Setting2": "Value2" } }
```

### Force install the CheerpJ JNLP Runner extension

You can use the `ExtensionInstallForcelist` policy to force install an extension, or you can use`ExtensionSettings` policy.

For the `ExtensionSettings` policy, you will need to use the `installation_mode` setting and set it to `force_install`.
You will also need to add `update_url` setting, which specifies where the browser should download the extension from.
For extensions hosted in the official browser's app store, you should use the app store's URLs.
If you are self-hosting your extension, this setting should point to the `manifest.xml` of the extension.

Policy string for **official Chrome** extension:

```json
{
	"achnhggjjhnadfapkmgallnbmemdojdi": {
		"installation_mode": "force_install",
		"update_url": "https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx"
	}
}
```

Policy string for **official Edge** extension

```json
{
	"dpleickbpchmkpkmicanfolmianepfhe": {
		"installation_mode": "force_install",
		"update_url": "https://edge.microsoft.com/extensionwebstorebase/v1/crx"
	}
}
```

> [!info] Make sure the policy string is in a single line

### Pin the CheerpJ JNLP Runner extension to the toolbar

To automatically pin the extension to the toolbar you can use the `ExtensionSettings` policy, the setting property has a differnt name for
[Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/9867568?hl=en) and [Edge](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/deployedge/microsoft-edge-manage-extensions-ref-guide).

Policy string for **official Chrome** extension:

```json
{ "achnhggjjhnadfapkmgallnbmemdojdi": { "toolbar_pin": "forced_pin" } }
```

Policy string for **official Edge** extension

```json
{ "dpleickbpchmkpkmicanfolmianepfhe": { "toolbar_state": "force_shown" } }
```

## Configuring Extension Settings via Windows Registry (Managed Storage)

The CheerpJ JNLP Runner extension supports Chrome Managed Storage, allowing certain settings to be preconfigured via the Windows registry.

These values are read-only in the extension and must be set by an administrator.

### Registry Path

Custom settings must be stored under the following registry path, replacing `<extension-id>` with the extension’s actual ID (see previous [Extension ID](#the-extension-id) section):

- **Chrome**  
  32-bit Windows  
  `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Google\Chrome\3rdparty\extensions\<extension-id>\policy`  
  64-bit Windows  
  `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Wow6432Node\Policies\Google\Chrome\3rdparty\extensions\<extension-id>\policy`

- **Edge**  
  32-bit Windows  
  `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Edge\3rdparty\extensions\<extension-id>\policy`  
  64-bit Windows  
  `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Wow6432Node\Policies\Microsoft\Edge\3rdparty\extensions\<extension-id>\policy`

### Policy Formatting

Each custom setting corresponds to a property defined in the extension’s managed storage schema.
The name, type, and structure of the registry entry must match the schema exactly.

To configure a custom setting, create a new string value under the extension’s policy registry key.
Set the value name to the setting’s name, and set the value data to the appropriate value in the format required by the schema.

### `licenseToken`

_Supported since version `2025.9`_

This setting is used to provide the enterprise license token to the extension.

The schema is as follows:

```json
"licenseToken": {
	"type": "string"
}
```

Since this setting is a simple string, all you need to do is create a new string key named `licenseToken` and set its value to your provided token.
