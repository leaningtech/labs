This platform allows users to practice coding problems in Python, featuring a split-view workspace with problem instructions on one side and a code editor with a built-in console on the other. The platform runs code client-side using CheerpX, which emulates a virtual machine in the browser. This eliminates the need for server-based execution, improving speed, privacy, and scalability.

This project was developed as part of the WebVM Hackathon, leveraging CheerpX for WebAssembly-powered client-side execution of Python code in the browser. It mimics platforms like NeetCode.io, enabling users to practice coding problems and receive immediate feedback by running their code directly in the browser. The goal of this project is to showcase the potential of WebVM for delivering powerful terminal-based applications without the need for native installations.
