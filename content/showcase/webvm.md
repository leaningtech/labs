WebVM is a virtual Linux environment running in the browser via WebAssembly. WebVM is powered by the CheerpX virtualization engine, which enables safe, sandboxed client-side execution of x86 binaries, fully client-side. Being built completely on standard Web technologies - WebAssembly in particular - it is fully isolated from your system and your other browser tabs.

CheerpX includes an x86-to-WebAssembly JIT compiler, a virtual block-based file system, and a Linux syscall emulator

## Claude Integration

WebVM integrates The Computer Use feature from Claude. Since Claude APIs can be used directly from a browser tab, itâ€™s possible to combine them with WebVM to create a secure and private environment to experiment with Claude Computer Use capabilities. Please read more about WebVM and Claude integration in our dedicated [blog post](https://cheerpx.io/blog/webvm-claude).
