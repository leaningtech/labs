Earlier this year, we were pleased to host the second edition of our now traditional WebVM: The Hackathon. We were elated to see many members of our online community, along with Leeds tech enthusiasts and professionals, participating. Today, we are excited to announce something new: a CheerpJ-themed hackathon, which (as usual) will take place both online and in-person in Leeds!

And guess what? The winning team will receive some Ama$ing prize$!

## CheerpJ in a nutshell

CheerpJ is a tool that has been widely adopted in various fields to run Java code in the browser without requiring a local Java installation, including in educational and scientific applications. This allows for a wide range of applications to be available in the browser client-side, which might otherwise not be accessible without local installations and dependencies.

## Event details

Prep your seatbelts and save the dates!

## The hackathon theme: Scientific Java

Java is popular for scientific and educational purposes. We believe this is the perfect theme for the first edition of the CheerpJ hackathon, as it is not only enjoyable but also useful, leading to projects that can have a significant impact. Fun fact: most of our company team members have a scientific or engineering background, and we are deeply passionate about all things science!

The basic rule: all projects must integrate CheerpJ and follow the theme. Examples of projects that meet the theme criteria:

- Any existing scientific Java application running in the browser (there are numerous examples!)
- Any scientific WebApp utilizing a Java library in the background by utilizing CheerpJ in library mode.
- Any web tool employing a Java app to some capacity and extent.
- A Java application created by you from scratch to solve a scientific problem or address any scientific application.

## Who can participate?

We encourage individuals from all levels and diverse technical backgrounds to join in as a team. Let us remember that good projects are the result of a team effort where people with varying strengths and skill sets contribute holistically.
Here is a non-exhaustive list of skills that could be valuable among team members:

- Basic programming
- Basic web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Fundamental understanding of Java
- Graphic/visual design and UX (if you want to enhance the visual appeal and usability of your project!)
- Testing expertise
- Project management
- Any person with domain knowledge of the project you want to work on
